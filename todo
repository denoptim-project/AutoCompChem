# TO DO LIST
#

- handling of wrotten SMARTS string (src/uibkvant/smarts/ManySMARTSQuery.java)

- make ACC use Gaussian chk/out files as input

-make ACC use high-precision coordinate files (XYZ with double precision floats)

-impose writing information on checkpoint file (Test.FChk) with the fchk keyword
- get info from Gaussian out/chk/fchk
-- in OUT the number of imaginary frequencies is reported in "NImag=0" string
   of the summary
-- in OUT the point group is reported as "PG=C01"
-- connectivity in FCHK:
--- "MxBond": maximum number of atoms bonded to a single atom.
--- "NBond": how many bonds for each atom 
--- "IBond": which atoms are bonded to each single atom (there are MxBond
             indeces for each atom)
--- "RBond": formal bond order (there are MxBond number for each atom)
-- total energy
-- Cartesian gradient
-- Cartesian forcs constants
-- charges
   
-remove zmatrix from generation of ZCOORD block in NWChem input generator

-make ManySMARTSQuery capable of detecting equal SMARTS with different refName

-mode redundant methods for reading and storing SMARTS-based rules defining options related to internal coordinates (see VibModuleOutputHandler and NWChemInputWriter).

- thing like ZMatrixHandler and BasisSetGenerator and MolecularMeter should be constructable without WorkerFacory

- remove OS dependency from t123

- make singleton worker registry and task id registry

- make task names and keywords work also with spaces and "usign the quotations"

- t116 QMMM
- t53 QMMM
- t63 reading from previous job's output
- subDirectives to directives

- edit bond (change order or type, remove bond)
- Mane circumstance use a user-provided python script to analyse any data resulting form analysis of job steps.

- document assumption that a job is assumed to be the only job in a working directory. So, when job isarchived, we take any *.inp, *.log, etc. This also means that we cannot run test in parallel in the same work directory.
