# TO DO LIST

- handling of wrotten SMARTS string (src/uibkvant/smarts/ManySMARTSQuery.java)

- make ACC use Gaussian chk/out files as input

-make ACC use high-precision coordinate files (XYZ with double precision floats)

-impose writing information on checkpoint file (Test.FChk) with the fchk keyword
- get info from Gaussian out/chk/fchk
-- in OUT the number of imaginary frequencies is reported in "NImag=0" string
   of the summary
-- in OUT the point group is reported as "PG=C01"
-- connectivity in FCHK:
--- "MxBond": maximum number of atoms bonded to a single atom.
--- "NBond": how many bonds for each atom 
--- "IBond": which atoms are bonded to each single atom (there are MxBond
             indeces for each atom)
--- "RBond": formal bond order (there are MxBond number for each atom)
-- total energy
-- Cartesian gradient
-- Cartesian forcs constants
-- charges
   
-deal with ACCparams in gaussian step
-convert ACCparams in key:value in jobdetails (needed to restart or create new jobdetails from failed calculations)

-make the <software>OutputHandler, <software>ReStarter, and <software>InputWriter be superclass of a generic class 

-remove zmatrix from generation of ZCOORD block in NWChem input generator

-make ManySMARTSQuery capable of detecting equal SMARTS with different refName

-all-upper-case for constants in GaussianConstants

-mode redundant methods for reading and storing SMARTS-based rules defining options related to internal coordinates (see VibModuleOutputHandler and NWChemInputWriter).


- thing like ZMatrixHandler and BasisSetGenerator and MolecularMeter should be constructable without WorkerFacory

- use shell job to start ezternal software (e.g. Gaussian)

- make master job able to react to the perception of an error and the inpulse to perform an error fixing action
