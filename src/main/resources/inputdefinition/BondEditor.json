In each line, each space-separated string (i.e., a word) is interpreted as following: each word is interpreted as a single SMARTS until a word is found that corresponds to any keyword or key-value pair. Keywords include: 'REMOVE', which indicates that any bond matched by that rule should be removed. Key-value pairs include: 'ORDER: value' (use this to set the bond order of any matched bond), and 'STEREO: value' (use this to set the stereochemistry flag of any matched bond). Once the first keyword is found no more words will be interpreted as SMARTS. To edit existing bonds, a single SMARTS should be used to identify the two atoms connected by the target bond (e.g., '[#6]-[#8]'). To add bonds, a pair of SMARTS can be used to identify the atoms to be connected by a bons, if not already connected (e.g., '[#6] [17] ORDER: Single' is the rule to add a single bond between each pair of non-bonded C and Cl atoms)."
