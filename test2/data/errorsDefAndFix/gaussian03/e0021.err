# Reference Name 
ReferenceName: e0021-ConvergenceFailure
# String/s to be searched in Gaussian .out file (only in the last step section)
ErrorMessage: Convergence criterion not met
ErrorMessage: Convergence failure -- run terminated
# further condition to be satisfied for an error to be classified as e0021
Condition: match "e0010-QCNoLowerPoint"
#
#
# Definition of Action to be taken when this error occours
#
# Type of action 
Action: Skip_step
# This erro occours after the action to fix another error (e0010)
# Since the intent is only to run a single step with DIIS in lieu of QC
# (during SCF calculation), the extra step added by e0010 will never
# converge. Thus, once this single DIIS step is done we recall back the
# original stap (which returned e0010 in the first place) and try again.
